And also I would not want to jeopardize this opportunity. Also i want
you to bear one thing in mind, there is no risk involved and the
transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you and I from any breach of law, therefore assuring you it is
100% secured as long as you are following my instructions at any
giving time. I must let you know that this is not a hoax arrangement
or any kind of joke. This is real and goes on in banks all over the
world without people knowing. A lot of customers open private accounts
with different banks and deposit valuable items without the knowledge
of their families and when they die, such money will be lost to the
bank, unless someone comes to claim it, and this is how a lot of bank
directors make so much money silently. Also you must know that it is
not always compulsory to have a relationship with person before you
become the next of kin, let us utilize this opportunity because it
does not come always. I shall take care of informations related to the
account once the transfer is concluded. Therefore! the first step is
to place your name as the Next of Kin to the account in our bank
database so that all information will reflect accordingly. In this
regard, you have to send me the following informations below;

YOUR FULL NAMES.
YOUR COUNTRY AND CITY.
DATE OF BIRTH.
A SCAN COPY OF YOUR ID.
YOUR PROFESSION.
YOUR OFFICE, HOME OR POSTAL ADDRESS.
AND MOBILE PHONE NUMBERS.

Once I receive these informations and conclude with all changes in the
bank database, I shall quickly inform you what next to do

Regards.

Hello, thanks for taking your time to read my letter and I`m sorry to
encroach into your privacy in this manner, though we do not know in
person. However, it is an urgent need for a foreign partner that move
me to contact you. I have a business proposal to share with you which
will interest you and benefit both of us as well, thank you.
