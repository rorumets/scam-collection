Sir/Ma,

We wish to inform you that a power of attorney was forwarded to our office =
this morning, by two gentlemen regarding your unclaimed fund of $2.5 Millio=
n Dollar. One of them is an American citizen named Mr. Robert Porter and th=
e other is Mr. Wilhelm Berg a Swedish citizen.

The document claims these gentlemen to be your authorized representatives, =
and the power of attorney states that you are already deceased.  It further=
 states that your death was due to lung cancer, with your date of death bei=
ng March 27th, 2019.

They have now submitted a new account to replace the receiving account that=
 was in the original claim of funds. These funds have remained unclaimed fo=
r quite some time and the need for resolution is pressing.

Below is the new account they have submitted.

Account Name's :  Robert Porter /Wilhelm Berg

In the event that you are in fact still alive, we ask that you confirm your=
 existence by responding to this email. You are to view this as a matter re=
quiring immediately attention and response.  We have 48 hr monitoring of al=
l activities within Federal Reserve  Bank.

We have contacted the bank in the Sweden asking them to wait for further di=
rectives from Federal Reserve Bank, prior to authorizing any withdrawals in=
 any form.  Our request is based entirely on our attempt to verify that you=
 are in fact deceased, before money is wrongly disbursed.


Finally, we forewarn you that if we do not hear back from you shortly, we w=
ill have to assume that you are in fact deceased and Federal Reserve bank w=
ill proceed with release funds to the above newly submitted account.



Sincerely,
